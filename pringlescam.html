                <br>
                <p class = "para"> It's what it sounds like: a Pringles can, but also a camera. I first thought of this by putting my phone vertically in a Pringles Can to hold it, but then a friend told me to stick it horizontally through the can, and so we had the Pringles Cam.</p>
                <br>
                <p class = "para"> Originally, I just wanted something to record myself with in cubing competitions that wasn't super expensive (like a Go-Pro) or that would fall over easily (also like a Go-Pro). Pringles cans are pretty cheap (under $1 / can) and also have a hard time falling over, which is a perfect fit. Plus, it just looks funny to see a phone inside one. Here's a few photos of how it looks and the angle it captures:</p>

                        <li>A cutting tool (preferably small). I used a utility knife because that's what I have.</li>
                        <li>(Recommended) Some electrical tape. Not everyone has this, but it's good for the cardboard and for your phone screen.</li>

I'd also suggest cutting down the height of the can instead of punching a hole with the blade because the latter can make the can collapse. If the slit ends up just a bit too thin, you can either use scissors to make it slightly wider or use a knife to shave off enough cardboard to </p>
