[{"content":"This page allows you to search and view the algorithms I use to solve the Rubik\u0026rsquo;s cube blindfolded. This includes the classic 3x3, the 4x4 cube, and the 5x5 cube.\nEnter BLD algorithm to visualize:\nFull alg: test Usage Guide Searching Commutators As of 6/25/24:\nYou can use sticker notation to search up commutators. Piece names are derived from the names of the faces that they form the intersection of. In this notation, the first letter of the sticker name should be the face that the sticker lies on. For example, the white sticker of the white-green edge on a 3x3 is UF, but the green sticker of the same piece is FU (if you are holding the cube in WCA orientation). Corners all have two possible names. UFR and URF are both correct names for the white sticker of the white-red-green corner (assuming WCA orientation). For larger cubes, pieces on inner slices use lowercase letters to indicate an inner slice. For example, Ufr refers to the center closest to the UFR piece on a 4x4. It may also refer to the x center closest to the UFR piece on a 5x5. You can add the cube name in brackets (e.g. [4x4], [3x3x3]) in front of the commutator name ([4x4] Ufr-Ldb-Fdl). This is useful (and necessary) in cases of ambiguity, like the one listed on the above bullet point. It may also be useful to visualize an algorithm on a different cube, like with corner commutators on different puzzles. If the puzzle name is not specified, the smaller cube is used by default. Examples UF-UB-UR will query the 3x3 edge commutator for the UF buffer with UB (A in Speffz) as the first target and UR (B in Speffz) as the second target. This alg is a U perm. [5x5] UF-UR-BD will query the 5x5 midge commutator algorithm for the UF buffer with UR as the first target and BD as the second target. Things I want to add to this page eventually The ability to search up parity algorithms (2e2c), flips, and twists. 2e2e, 2c2c would also be nice. The ability to search up commutators using Speffz or a custom piece-name mapping.
