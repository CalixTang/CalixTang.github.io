                    <h2>Intro</h2>
                    <p class = "para">This project is a simulator for my favorite twisty-puzzle: the Square-One. You can look at the source code here: <a href = "https://github.com/CalixTang/SquanSim" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener">link</a>. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class = "para">Before I go on to the project, I think it would be a good idea to show you how a Square-One works. If you're familiar with Squan, just scroll down a bit.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class = "para">The Square-One in its solved state looks like a cube. But do you see how the pieces look different? Like a 3x3, there are two types of pieces that move around: edges and pieces. Unlike a 3x3, edges have an internal angle of 30 degrees and corners have an angle of 60 degrees (which makes corners larger). The top and bottom layers can rotate and the "slice" can too, but only in increments of 180 degrees. This slice is at a 30 degree angle too.</p>
                    <br>                    <br>
                    <h2>Modeling</h2>
                    <p class = "para">It took me a while to figure out how to express a Square-One's state in terms of code, but I figured it out eventually. I modeled the cube as 2 arrays, each representing a layer (top or bottom), with 12 numbers in them. Each edge has one number and each corner two numbers. Finally, the "equator" (the bar in the middle that flips around) is also either 'solved' or 'not solved', which is easily represented as a boolean.
                    <br>
                    <p class = "para">To the right is a diagram of a Square-One with the pieces in the solved state. The first array ("up") would contain elements 1 through 12 and the second array ("down") would contain elements 13 through 24. Notice that because each corner has two numbers, those number MUST stick be in the same array and next to each other. For example, having "8" in one array and "9" in the other would be an invalid state because a corner cannot separate across layers. However, I also had to make sure that the arrays allowed looping so that corners could theoretically be over a slice/edge.</p>

                    <h2>The Program + Features</h2>
                    <p class = "para">I wrote this program in Java with the Processing library for a GUI.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class = "para">Features:</p>
                    <ul class = "bullet-list">
                        <li>Accurately captures movement of pieces and prevents user from entering an invalid state.</li>
                        <li>Command-line input that allows users to type in algorithms and other commands.</li>
                        <li>Displays last algorithm or command executed in the top center. Also outputs error messages.</li>
                        <li>Multiple commands: reset (for auto-solving the puzzle), invert (inverting algorithms), stepthrough (for going through an algorithm one step at a time), and commands to toggle cosmetic options.</li>
                        <li>Pasting capabilities for the command line.</li>
                        <li>Saves state of puzzle and cosmetic options when closing the applet.</li>
                        <li>Cosmetic Options:
                            <ul class = "bullet-list">
                                <li>Karnaukh Notation: This is a more streamlined version of the normal Square-One notation.</li>
                                <li>Color Scheme: Some people prefer black tiles instead of yellow, so I added an option to toggle tile color.</li>
                                <li>Cap Scheme: The side tiles are switchable, which switches the top and bottom colors in the solved state.</li>
                                <li>Rendering: 2D and 3D rendering options available (but 3D is cooler).</li>
                            </ul>
